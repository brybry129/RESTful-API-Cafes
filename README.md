# RESTful API Cafes

This is a test API I built in Python using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## Dependencies
This project requires a SQLAlchemy database named "cafes.db". To be able to use any of the GET functions you must first add info into the database. Please see the [API documentation](#API Documentation) below.

Install the modules needed:
```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
